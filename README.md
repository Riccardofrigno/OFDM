# OFDM Projects

This repository collects MATLAB/Simulink projects on **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**.  
All simulations use **16-QAM modulation** and include numerical results as well as graphical outputs.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **OFDM_basic/**  
  Basic OFDM model over an AWGN channel (numbers + plots).

- **OFDM_LDPC/**  
  OFDM with **LDPC coding** for error correction (numbers + plots).

- **OFDM_multipath_Doppler/**  
  OFDM with **multipath fading and Doppler effect**, using **LDPC coding and pilot symbols**.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- MATLAB R2024b (tested)  
- Communications System Toolbox (for LDPC coding and channel models)

## ðŸ“‘ Notes
These projects are part of my thesis work on digital communication systems and focus on the performance of OFDM under different channel conditions and with error-correcting codes.
